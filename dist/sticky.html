        Body stripes are less numerous and broader than that of the Cape
        Mountain Zebra, whereas body stripes extend around the belly. Leg
        striping is less prominent. Measures 1.3 to 1.4 metres at the shoulder
        and weighs 300-320 Kg. They have rounded ears approximately 160-170 mm
        long. Front portion of mane forms a black tuft between the ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Burchell's Zebra lives in small family units, which typically
        consist of one stallion and one mare with their foals. Non-breeding
        stallions occur in bachelor groups. Herd stallions are between four to
        12 years old. Water holes in conjunction with favoured grazing areas
        attract family groups which collectively congregate in large numbers.
        They are often seen in close association with Wildebeest, other plains
        Antelope and Baboons.

      <p>
        The White Rhino is the third largest land mammal. Massive, stocky, and
        with a reputation of being not quite as aggressive as the Black Rhino.
        The two distinctive horns are in fact very densely packed fibers, and
        materially not really horns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The record horn length is 1.58 m. Bulls, weighing up to 2 000 kg, are
        larger than cows which weigh up to 1 800 kg. Bulls are 1.8 m at the
        shoulders. The grey skin is almost hairless. They have a square-shaped,
        wide mouth. White Rhinos have a hump on the neck. The penis points
        backwards and testes are located abdominally.
      </p>
      <p>
        The White Rhino is strictly a grazer. Favouring short grass, but will
        feed on taller grass when short grass is not available. The wide mouth
        enables adequate intake with each plug harvested with the upper and
        lower lips.

      <p>
        The handsome slate-brown shaggy coat is marked with white vertical
        stripes and spots on the flanks. Bulls appear more charcoal-grey in
        colour. The bulls have long inward curved horns (650 mm) and a white
        chevroned face. They have a ridge of long hairs along the underparts,
        from behind the chin to between the hind legs, they also have a mane of
        thick, black hair from the head along the spine to the rump. Bulls weigh
        115 Kg and measures 1.05 m at shoulders. Cows are much smaller and do
        not have horns, and weigh 59 Kg and stand 900mm at shoulders. Cows are
        chestnut-coated with even more prominent white stripes on the flanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        They breed throughout the year, but mating peaks in autumn and spring.
        Single calves are born after a gestation period of 220 days. Twins are
        not uncommon. Cows first conceive between 14 to 18 months. Average
        interval between births is 297 days. Mating opportunities for bulls are
        decided through dominance behaviour.
