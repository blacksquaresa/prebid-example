      <p>
        It took me an age to work out why the prebid request for bids was not
        working. I eventually tracked it down to not working with a localhost
        domain. I had webpack dev server set up using a localhost domin on
        https, with a cert, but it was still not working. It was only when I
        loaded the page on a live server that I finally saw it working, and
        realised the issue.
