      <p>
        Warthogs are day animals and spend most of their time looking for food.
        They are normally found in family groups. Warthogs have the peculiar
        habit of kneeling on the front knees while feeding and foraging in a
        localised area. They shelter in burrows at night, which they enter tail
        first. Socially, three main groups are encountered, namely solitary
        boars, bachelor groups and matriarchal groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matriarchal groups consist of adult sows with their young and yearlings.
        Boars play no part in rearing piglets and seldom associate with sows
        outside the mating process. Promiscuous, both sexes will mate with more
        than one partner. Warthogs can frequently be found at waterholes where
        they dig in the marsh and wallow in the mud with obvious enthusiasm.

      <p>
        The Elephant is the world's largest land mammal, and weighs up to 7
        tonnes and reaches heights of 3.3 m at the shoulder. Elephants can live
        to a potential age of 70 years. The massive tusks of older bulls can
        weigh up to 50 or 60 kilograms, but tusks weighing up to 90 kilograms
        have been recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the trunk and what is it used for? The Elephant's trunk is a
        modified nose which is very sensitive and can even detect water under
        ground. There are as many as 50 000 muscles in an Elephant trunk. The
        sensitive finger-like appendages at the tip of the trunk enables them to
        pick the smallest twig or flower, pull the toughest reed of grass or
        even pick out a thorn from their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do elephants have knees or elbows? The joints that are perceived as
        'knees', are in fact wrists. This is a common misunderstanding due to
        the belief that a leg joint that bends between the foot and the body
        must be a knee. The main difference between us and the elephants is that
        our foot bones and hand bones are separate, whereas those of the
        elephant are one in the same, and have evolved to suit this four-legged
        mammal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do elephants have tusks? The tusks are used for obtaining food,
        fighting (amongst males) and for self defence. They are actually their
        upper incisors, and grow continuously until they die at around 60 years
        old. Although their skin is up to 3cm (1 inch) thick, it is quite
        sensitive.
